My name is Kyaw Nay Myo latt and my nickname is Maximilian MÃ¤xchen. But everyone calls me Max. I am an official German-speaking tour guide in Myanmar. I learned German at the Goethe Institute up to B2 and had received a certificate from the government as a tour guide. I've been working since 2018 I work as a tour guide in Myanmar. I accompany tourists all over the world. I am also gay. I organize the whole trip for the tourists in Myanmar, my hobbies are reading, traveling, singing and dancing.
