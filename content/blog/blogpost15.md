Hpa-an  the capital of Kayin is known for the 20 caves roughly 1.5 million inhabitants and a small town in Myanmar. It is located on the banks of the Thanlwin River, which is the longest river in Myanmar. Beautiful city and place to visit though. My Berliner likes this place. There are hardly any tourists in the city and few tourists see us on the way. We never see any Germans.
